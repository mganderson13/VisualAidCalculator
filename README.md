# VisualAidCalculator

This is a visual aid calculator for students, targeted at grades 1-5.

Description:
This fully functional calculator comes with added visual support for younger students.
Elementary grade level appropriate equations are animated using common visual representations of operations.

This website was developed by two certified teachers in the Chicago area, with the goal of providing visual aid to younger students or students needing extra supports.
Combined with personal expertise and established curriculums we chose representations for each operation that will be familiar to students and visually demonstrate the concept of each basic operation.
Using Common Core Standards we set a range for operations that show a visual aid, adding and subtracting within 1000 and multiplying and dividing by numbers up to 20.

Stack:
This project is developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a showcase of the serviceability of vanilla JavaScript.

Beacuse the animations are dynamic, the DOM elements are created in JavaScript functions based on the input from the calculator. The functions create, design, adjust, and place divs to illustrate the operations using vanilla JavaScript, no animation expertise here! Just two teachers using the skills they have to help students!

Sprite Sheets:
The animated arrows used to demonstrate addition and subtraction are created using a Sprite Sheet. We imported the Sprite Sheet which was created by one of our fantastic developers/teachers. The animate function draws the arrows onto a canvas HTML element. To create an animated effect, it loops through consecutive frames of the image. The function loops through the "rightArrow" frames of the image for the purple addition arrow, and the "leftArrow" frames for the pink subtraction arrow.

Thank you for checking out our Visual Aid Calculator!
